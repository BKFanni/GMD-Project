-Now is the time for us to add more excitement to our game by introducing enemies. I placed the first enemy in the level 1 scene and added components such as Box Collider 2D and Rigidbody 2D. Additionally, I attached an Edge Collider 2D to the enemy's sword and enabled 'isTrigger' for both colliders. I animated the enemy asset, creating Idle and Walk animations for now. Then, I developed an enemy controller to manage the states and transitions between each state. For example, I set a condition for transitioning from the idle state to the walk state when 'moving' equals true.

I implemented a Game AI for enemy movement between two points. The enemy should alternate between idle and walking movements. Upon reaching point 2, it flips to face the other direction and moves back to point 1. I achieved this using the EnemyMovement script, which defines the two points, move speed, and idle time. The script updates the animator component to change the animation state based on whether the enemy is moving or idle.
