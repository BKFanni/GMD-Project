-Now is the time for us to add more excitement to our game by introducing enemies. I placed the first enemy in the level 1 scene and added components such as Box Collider 2D and Rigidbody 2D. Additionally, I attached an Edge Collider 2D to the enemy's sword and enabled 'isTrigger' for both colliders. I animated the enemy asset, creating Idle and Walk animations for now. Then, I developed an enemy controller to manage the states and transitions between each state. For example, I set a condition for transitioning from the idle state to the walk state when 'moving' equals true.

I implemented a Game AI for enemy movement between two points. The enemy should alternate between idle and walking movements. Upon reaching point 2, it flips to face the other direction and moves back to point 1. I achieved this using the EnemyMovement script, which defines the two points, move speed, and idle time. The script updates the animator component to change the animation state based on whether the enemy is moving or idle.
This task was challenging for me because it took time for me to figure out what is the problem and how to fix it so I contacted Fanni and she helped me to find the issues to not have the points as a child to the enemy game object.

I worked on the Audio setup for our project, first of all, I ensured that the Audio listener component was added to the camera then, I installed the Audio clip for the game background and added it to the hierarchy as a game object with the audio source, I ensure that the play on wake and loop is checked so the audio will be continued during the play experience.

First of all, I created a Don't Destroy On Load script that can be applied to any gameobject. With that script, we ensure that certain gameobject don't get destroyed when the scene changes. So far, I use this script on the Player and the Cameras. The reason for having the script on the Cameras as well, is that we do not want to set them with the same settings every time there is a new scene. In the future we will also add that script to the audio so that it will be compatible with the cameras too. I made the EnterNextLevel script so that it can be reused, we can just specify the name of the next scene in the Inpector. 

Then I imported new characters from the character asset into the project, that we use as enemy characters now. After that, I made a FollowPlayer script that are used for the enemies to follow the player when it approaches them. We can specify the distance/range between the Player and the enemy, so that if the Player is within that distance from the enemy, the enemy is triggerred and starts to follow the Player. I also added the animations accordingly, such as Run animation that is activated when the enemy follows the Player.

In the meantime we encountered some issues with the enemy animations, so I figured out what the problem was and fixed it for the two existing animations: idle and walk. 

Then when Marwa set up the first enemy, I helped her figuring out why the Game AI she implemented was not working as intended. I figured that the waypoints (the 2 points where the enemy is supposed to walk between) were not set up correctly. So Instead of having the waypoints as children of the initial enemy gameobject, I created an empty gameobject called "Enemy" as a parent, then set the actual enemy gameobject (with the sprite and scripts, etc) as child of the parent object, and another child for the parent called "Waypoints" that has 2 children (pointA and pointB). This approach fixed the problem with the Game AI, (idle and walk between two points) so now it works as intended.
